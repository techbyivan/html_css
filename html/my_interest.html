		<h2>Ok, First Things First...</h2>
		<ul>
			<h3><li>Who invented it...</li></h3>
			<p>
				Although this can be a contentious topic for advanced engineers, one of
				the first documents referencing <br />
				the topic & theory, was by a gentlemen named Donald Hebb in 1949. He
				wrote a book entitled

			<h3><li>What is it...</li></h3>
			<p>
				Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve
				automatically through experience.
			</p>
			<h3><li>When is it used...</li></h3>
			<p>
				Machine Learning personalization algorithms are used to offer product
				recommendations to customers, amognst an assortment <br />
				of other things.
			</p>
			<h3><li>Where can I find it...</li></h3>
			<p>
				You can find it in many software applications from U.S. Government
				internal systems to your favorite ride sharing mobile apps such as
				<br />
				Uber & Lyft.
			</p>
			<h3><li>Why is it important...</li></h3>
			<p>
				It's important because technology is moving at such a rapid pace, it is
				our responsibility to acknowledge and recognize <br />
				the power of algorithms. These algorithms will shape and influence our
				existence as humans.
			</p>
			<h3><li>How can I learn more...</li></h3>
			<p>
				You can learn more about Machine Learning simply by clicking on any
				<br />
				of the links provided below.
