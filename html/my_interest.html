			<h2>Ok, First Things First...</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3><li>Who invented it...</li></h3>
				<p>
					Although this can be a contentious topic for advanced engineers, one
					of the first documents referencing the topic & theory, was <br />
					by a gentlemen named Donald Hebb in 1949. He wrote a book entitled

				<h3><li>What is it...</li></h3>
				<p>
					Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve
					automatically through experience.
				</p>
				<h3><li>When is it used...</li></h3>
				<p>
					Machine Learning personalization algorithms are used to offer product
					recommendations to customers, amongst an assortment <br />
					of other things.
				</p>
				<h3><li>Where can I find it...</li></h3>
				<p>
					You can find it in many software applications from U.S. Government
					internal systems to your favorite ride sharing mobile apps such as
					<br />
					Uber & Lyft.
				</p>
				<h3><li>Why is it important...</li></h3>
				<p>
					It's important because technology is moving at such a rapid pace, it
					is our responsibility to acknowledge and recognize <br />
					the power of algorithms. These algorithms will shape and influence our
					existence as humans.
				</p>
				<h3><li>How can I learn more...</li></h3>
				<p>
					You can learn more about Machine Learning simply by clicking on any
					<br />
					of the links provided below.
